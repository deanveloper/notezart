# Notezart

A better music bot for better streamers.

Will have the following features:
 - [ ] Request songs via chat or web interface
 - [ ] Disallow certain songs, artists, or keywords
 - [ ] Web interface for viewing the song list
 - [ ] Web interface for listening to the queue
 - [ ] Front-facing API to allow developers to make their own frontends

Since I need to pay for hosting, I'll have a premium plan
which will allow streamers to have configurable responses.

Will probably only allow songs from YouTube. I'm not 100% sure on that yet, though.
