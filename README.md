# Notezart

A better music bot for better streamers.

Will have the following features:
 - Disallow songs from certain artists
 - Disallow songs containing certain keywords (ie "minecraft parody")
 - Web interface

Since I need to pay for hosting, I'll have a premium plan
which will allow streamers to have configurable responses.

Will probably only allow songs from YouTube. I'm not 100% sure on that yet, though.
